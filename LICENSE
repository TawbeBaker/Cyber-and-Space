================================================================================
EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

This software is developed for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY as part of the NASA
Space Apps Challenge 2025 - Meteor Madness challenge.

IMPORTANT NOTICES:

1. EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE
   This simulator is designed for educational demonstration, scientific learning,
   and public outreach. It is NOT intended for actual planetary defense planning,
   operational decision-making, or mission-critical applications.

2. DATA SOURCES AND ATTRIBUTION
   This software integrates data from the following sources:

   a) NASA/JPL APIs and Databases:
      - NASA NEO (Near-Earth Object) Web Service API
      - NASA JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB)
      - NASA Horizons System (orbital elements)

      NASA Data Policy: All NASA data is publicly available and provided
      under NASA's Open Data Policy. NASA requires attribution but does not
      endorse this educational project.

      Citation: "Data courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech"
      Source: https://api.nasa.gov/

   b) USGS (United States Geological Survey):
      - USGS Elevation Point Query Service
      - USGS Earthquake Hazards Program data

      USGS Data Policy: USGS information is in the public domain and may be
      used without restriction.

      Citation: "Elevation and seismic data courtesy of USGS"

3. SCIENTIFIC MODELS AND LIMITATIONS

   The physics calculations in this simulator are based on peer-reviewed
   scientific literature but employ SIMPLIFIED MODELS for computational
   efficiency and educational clarity:

   a) Impact Physics Models:
      - Crater scaling laws: Collins et al. (2005), Holsapple (1993)
      - Energy calculations: Standard kinetic energy formula (E = Â½mvÂ²)
      - Blast effects: Simplified from Hills & Goda (1993), Hildebrand (1991)
      - Seismic magnitude: Schultz & Gault (1975)

   b) Orbital Mechanics:
      - Keplerian orbital elements (simplified two-body problem)
      - Newton-Raphson solver for Kepler's equation
      - Does NOT account for: planetary perturbations, non-gravitational
        forces, relativistic effects, or precise numerical integration

   c) Known Limitations:
      - Assumes spherical, homogeneous asteroids
      - Simplified atmospheric entry physics
      - Does not model fragmentation in atmosphere
      - Crater formation assumes idealized target properties
      - Population casualty estimates are statistical approximations
      - Deflection simulations use simplified momentum transfer models

4. ACCURACY AND VALIDATION

   While based on scientific principles, this simulator's results should be
   considered APPROXIMATE and suitable for:
   - Educational demonstrations
   - Understanding basic impact physics concepts
   - Comparing relative magnitudes of different scenarios
   - Public outreach and engagement

   Results should NOT be used for:
   - Actual planetary defense mission planning
   - Publishing scientific research without validation
   - Risk assessment for real Near-Earth Objects
   - Policy or decision-making purposes
